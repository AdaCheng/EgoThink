        "answer": "1. The majority of the rice grains are still in the frypan, indicating that the task of taking them out is not completed.\n2. The person is only picking up a few grains at a time, which is insufficient to complete the task of removing all the rice from the frypan.\n3. There is no visible container or place where the rice grains are being transferred to, suggesting that the task of taking out the rice is not being actively pursued or completed."
